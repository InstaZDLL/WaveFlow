# Playback engine

The audio path lives in [`src-tauri/src/audio/`](../../src-tauri/src/audio). It is a 3-thread lock-free pipeline; see [audio architecture](../architecture/audio.md) for the wider topology and invariants.

## Decoding & output

- **Decoder** — [`symphonia 0.5`](https://crates.io/crates/symphonia) over MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG Vorbis, AAC, ALAC (M4A). Source samples are converted to interleaved `f32`, channel-mapped (mono ↔ stereo, 5.1 → stereo Lo/Ro per ITU BS.775), then resampled to the device rate by [`rubato 2.0`](https://crates.io/crates/rubato) (`Fft<f32>` + `FixedSync::Input`, with a fast `Passthrough` variant when source rate already matches the device).
- **Output** — [`cpal 0.17`](https://crates.io/crates/cpal) on a dedicated thread because `cpal::Stream` is `!Send` on Windows. Samples cross the thread via an [`rtrb 0.3`](https://crates.io/crates/rtrb) SPSC ring (`RING_CAPACITY = 96 000` `f32`s ≈ 1 s @ 48 kHz stereo).
- **Hot-path rules** — the cpal callback never allocates, locks or logs. It only reads the `rtrb::Consumer` and `Atomic*` fields in `SharedPlayback`.

## Crossfade

Real dual-decoder mix in [`crossfade.rs`](../../src-tauri/src/audio/crossfade.rs). When the user enables crossfade, the decoder maintains two `ActiveStream`s during the fade window and feeds an equal-power gain pair (`cos(t·π/2)` / `sin(t·π/2)`) into each so the summed RMS stays flat — no mid-fade dip. The window is clamped to `min(user_ms, duration / 2)` so 30 s clips with a 12 s setting don't start mixing at the 18 s mark.

ReplayGain is applied **per-stream before the mix** so the two tracks can have very different gains without the louder one swamping the fade.

## Seek

`format.seek()` + `decoder.reset()` + `resampler.flush()`. The cpal callback enters `drain_silent` mode, which (since 70c1968) drains the ring in **one bulk `while consumer.pop()` pass** instead of one sample per output slot — total perceived gap on seek dropped from ~270 ms (one full ring at 44.1 kHz × 8 ch) to ~10-15 ms (one cpal callback period).

After the drain, MP3 sources will emit a few `invalid main_data_begin, underflow` warnings from symphonia: the bit reservoir is invalidated by the seek and the codec recovers within 3-4 frames. Inherent to the format; not a bug.

## Output device picker

[`commands/player.rs::list_output_devices`](../../src-tauri/src/commands/player.rs) → cpal device enumeration. The display name uses `description().extended()[0]` (Windows `DEVPKEY_Device_FriendlyName` — `Speakers (Logitech PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset)`) instead of `description().name()` (`DEVPKEY_Device_DeviceDesc` — just `Speakers`) so multiple endpoints in the same device class stay distinguishable.

The chosen device's name is persisted in `profile_setting['audio.output_device']`. `lib.rs::setup` reads it during boot and forwards it to the audio engine, so playback resumes on the user's preferred sink without waiting for the frontend to settle.

On Linux, enumeration uses ALSA's hint database (`snd_device_name_hint("pcm")`) instead of cpal's `output_devices()` to avoid a 1-2 s freeze + `pcm_dmix` / `pcm_route` stderr spam from probing every PCM card.

## OS media controls

[`media_controls.rs`](../../src-tauri/src/media_controls.rs) bridges the engine to [`souvlaki 0.8`](https://crates.io/crates/souvlaki):

- **Windows** — SMTC. Now-Playing artwork is served to SMTC over a tiny localhost HTTP shim because Windows expects a URL, not a file path.
- **Linux** — MPRIS via D-Bus.
- **macOS** — MediaRemote (NowPlayingInfoCenter).

Initialised after the main window exists (needs an HWND on Windows). State transitions are driven through `transition_state()` so the OS overlay flips at the same instant as the in-app controls; the brief `Loading` state is skipped to avoid a 50 ms "controls flash off" between tracks.

## Queue

[`queue.rs`](../../src-tauri/src/queue.rs) — persistent SQLite-backed queue with shuffle (Fisher-Yates with seeded xorshift), repeat (off/all/one), auto-advance and drag-and-drop reorder. The frontend operates on a virtualised list so a 6000-track shuffle doesn't lock the UI.
